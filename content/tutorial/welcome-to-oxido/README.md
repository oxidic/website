title: Welcome to Oxido
---

Welcome to the Oxido tutorial! This will teach you everything you need to know to easily build CLIs of all sizes, with high performance and a small footprint.

You can also consult the [API docs](https://oxido.megatank58.xyz/docs) or — if you're impatient to start hacking on your machine locally — create a project with `oxate init`.

## What is Oxido?

Oxido is a statically typed interpreted programming language for making CLI tools and
scripts.

You can build your entire CLI with Oxido, or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase.

## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial is split into two main parts:

- [Basic Oxido](/tutorial/welcome-to-oxido) (you are here)
- [Advanced Oxido](/tutorial/advanced)

Each section will present an exercise designed to illustrate a feature. Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the menu above.

Every section has a sample code with its output, feel free to fiddle around with it to see how different functions affect it differently.
